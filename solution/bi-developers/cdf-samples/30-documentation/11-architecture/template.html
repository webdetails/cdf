		The Dashboards.jsp page  (/pentaho/Dashboards) is called by the user and provides the access to all Dashboards.
		</p>

		<p> 

		As common within the Pentaho Solutions, this framework works on a set of assumptions concerning
		the organization and naming of the folder structure and files: Each dashboard is defined in a 
		separate folder and must contain two files, index.xml and template.html.The index.xml is used to
		identify the dashboard's name and description just as in any other folder in the Pentaho solution
		repository. The template.html file determines the dashboard's design.</p>

		<p> 
		 The content layout as well as the static content are defined with regular HTML. Any kind of component 
		can be used as a placeholder, being "div" and "span" tags the most commonly used. These information 
		objects are defined as dashboard components. <br/>
		</p>

		<p> 
		When the user calls up a dashboard, one or multiple components will be executed from the dashboard 
		library. Some of them will result in the executions of Action Sequences on the BI Platform. The platform 
		returns the results and the dashboard library will send the content to be displayed in the specified
		tag back to the browser.
